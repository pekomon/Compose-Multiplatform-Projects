# Compose Multiplatform Projects

This repository serves as a showcase and experimental ground for various small applications built using **Kotlin Multiplatform** and **Jetpack Compose for Multiplatform**. The goal is to demonstrate how multiplatform applications can be developed and maintained for Android, Desktop (JVM), and potentially other platforms.

## Goals

*   Showcase the power and flexibility of Kotlin Multiplatform and Jetpack Compose for Multiplatform.
*   Provide practical examples and templates for building multiplatform projects.
*   Serve as a learning resource for developers interested in these technologies.
*   Experiment with different architectures and libraries in a multiplatform environment.

## Sub-Projects

Here is a list of the sub-projects contained within this collection:

- [BouncyBee](./BouncyBee) – A fun and engaging multiplatform game.
- [Minesweeper](./Minesweeper/README.md) – Classic puzzle built with Compose Multiplatform.

## Technologies

This project and its sub-projects primarily utilize the following technologies:

*   **[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/):** A modern, concise, and safe programming language.
*   **[Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/lp/multiplatform/):** Enables sharing code between different platforms (Android, iOS, Desktop, Web).
*   **[Jetpack Compose for Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-multiplatform/):** A declarative UI toolkit for Android, Desktop, and Web (WASM), based on Google's Jetpack Compose.
*   **[Gradle](https://gradle.org/):** A build automation tool used for building the project and managing dependencies.
