Use the following badges to display the status of CryptoApp's GitHub Actions workflows.
Replace `<OWNER>` and `<REPO>` with the appropriate GitHub organization/user and repository names when adding the badges to documentation.

- Android: ![CryptoApp Android CI](https://github.com/<OWNER>/<REPO>/actions/workflows/cryptoapp-android.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)

To embed them in Markdown, use:
