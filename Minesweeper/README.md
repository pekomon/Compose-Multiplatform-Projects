# Minesweeper (Compose Multiplatform)

[![Minesweeper CI](https://github.com/pekomon/Compose-Multiplatform-Projects/actions/workflows/minesweeper-ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/pekomon/Compose-Multiplatform-Projects/actions/workflows/minesweeper-ci.yml)

A tiny Minesweeper built with Kotlin Multiplatform + Compose Multiplatform.
Core game logic is implemented as pure Kotlin shared across all targets.
- Material 3 theming with coordinated light and dark palettes. Android 12+ devices automatically adopt dynamic color.
- Custom splash screens and launcher icons across Android, iOS, Desktop and Web. Phase 1 ships text-only assets so the diff stays
  binary-free; branded bitmaps land in Phase 2.
